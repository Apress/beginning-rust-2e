Put all the files into a folder.
The example files have a name like 02-01.rs,
where "02" indicates the chapter, "01" is the sequential number,
and "rs" indicates the programming language.
The examples use "rs" for Rust language, "c" for C language, and "cpp" for C++ language.
To compile and run an example, for example the file 02-01.rs,
in a Unix-like shell, type:
    sh run.sh 02-01
in a Windows Command Prompt for Visual Studio, type:
    run 02-01
A folder named "target" will be created by such commands.
